# EF_MSU_Machine_Learning_course
## University ML projects including:

### _Workshop 1:_
- minimize various functions using gradient descent, Newton's method (implemented in __gradient_descent_minimization.py__) and my method (implemented in __blackbox_function_optimization.py__)

### _Workshop 2:_
- compute_criterion and find_best_split functions and the DecisionTree class are implemented, and categorical features are encoded in the fit() method (implemented in __decision_tree_creation.py__)

### _Workshop 3:_
- Random, User2User, and ALS recommendations models classes, MAP@k metric, and Jaccard Similarity are implemented (see __jaccard_similarity.py__, __mapk.py__, __recsys_models.py__)

### _Competition 1:_
- 15th place on the private leaderboard in the Kaggle competition on predicting insurance costs (regression problem; implemented in __MSU_competition_1_regression.ipynb__)
